						<div id="mission">
							<p>In November 2005, the Muslim Support Network (MSN) was established to improve the health and well-being of their elders. The organization was founded upon a realization within the Muslim community that elders’ needs were not being met by the community at large. </br> </br>

							This group realized that many Muslim elders were homebound, encountered language and cultural barriers, lacked transportation or finances and were suffering from both physical and mental health issues. </br> </br>

							Immediate action was taken by MSN in November, 2006 to partner with the City of Fremont’s Human Services Department (HSD). They created a program where the seniors could come out of their homes, and established a social and educational program to improve their lives.  MSN held its first community meeting late in November of 2006.</p>
